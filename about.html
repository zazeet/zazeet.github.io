        <p>I am an engineer from India. </p>
        <p>This site is home to any writings, projects or undertakings I go through with. </p>
        <p>I have committed to using simple technologies here, so I'll have to 
        figure out how to make this thing look like how I want it over time.
        </p> 
        <p>My blogs cover topics ranging from technology, literature, politics and things like that.</p>
